Hey, I'm Mriganka Brahma, a passionate individual with a diverse set of skills and experiences. Currently interning at E cell IIT Bombay, I am deeply involved in fostering entrepreneurship and innovation. As a Google Cloud Arcade Facilitator in 2023 and a GCCP Cloud facilitator in 2022, I enjoy sharing my knowledge of cloud computing and empowering others to harness the potential of cloud technologies. In addition to my cloud expertise, I also hold the role of Outreach Lead at GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs), where I actively engage with the community and help aspiring developers find their passion for technology. I take great pride in my achievements on platforms like HackerRank, where I've earned a 5-star rating, showcasing my problem-solving skills and dedication to continuous learning. As a web developer, I have a knack for crafting elegant and user-friendly solutions, combining my technical skills with a keen eye for design. My enthusiasm for machine learning and deep learning keeps me constantly exploring the cutting-edge advancements in these fields. Currently pursuing a B.Tech at BPPIMT, I am committed to academic excellence and personal growth. Additionally, I actively participated in Hacktoberfest 2022, contributing to the open-source community and giving back to the tech world that has given me so much. With an insatiable curiosity and a hunger for knowledge, I constantly seek new challenges and opportunities to expand my horizons. My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact on the world through technology and innovation.
